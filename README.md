# Crop Care AI Solution

## Abstract

In India, most of its economy comes from agriculture, making it the second largest producer of wheat and rice. Agriculture employs 60% of the Indian population and contributes 17% of the total GDP. This project introduces an innovative **Crop Care AI solution** designed for precision agriculture. 

The system leverages **ground sensors** to capture critical parameters such as **NPK levels**, **pH**, and **rainfall** in real-time. The collected data is sent to a database where **machine learning algorithms** analyze it to recommend suitable crops for the region. After choosing a crop, the AI provides recommendations for optimal fertilizer quantities. These insights and suggestions are accessible through a **mobile application**, enabling users to make informed decisions regardless of their location or expertise.

This integrated approach offers:
- **Real-time environmental insights**
- **Personalized crop advice**
- **Sustainable farming practices**
- **Improved crop yield**

The system empowers users with effective tools for efficient crop management and promotes better decision-making in agriculture.

## Features

- **Real-time data capture** from ground sensors
- **Machine learning analysis** for crop recommendations
- **Fertilizer quantity suggestions**
- **Mobile application** for easy access to recommendations
